This article demonstrates how documents prepared in hypertext or word processor format can be saved in portable document format (PDF). These files are self-contained documents that that have the same appearance on screen and in print, regardless of what kind of computer or printer are used, and regardless of what software package was originally used to for their creation. PDF files are compressed documents, invariably smaller than the original files, hence allowing rapid dissemination and download.
MeSH: Internet, Publishing Portable Document Format (PDF - Adobe) was created in order to allow formatted documents to be widely distributed regardless of whether specific fonts or postscript files are available on the user's system.1,2 PDF files have the ability to internally embed specialised fonts, images, colours and formatting regardless of the application and platform used for the documentsâ€™ creation. This ensures that as long as the user has the ability to read PDF files, documents will be viewed exactly as formatted by the original authors, with both appearance and content integrity.
Moreover, for online viewing, the browser plug-in is stable, easy to use and available for download. PDF files also allow the easy distribution of large documents, and the indexing facility inbuilt in the PDF format can create a fast lookup system. PDF is one of the most portable file formats available, and does not require a browser for viewing, only the Acrobat Reader which is free and compact. PDF files can also be viewed on Palm devices. The PDF format has been found to be very reliable, and is used for the dissemination of official documents by governments worldwide (Adobe Acrobat and PDF - essential tools for e-government).

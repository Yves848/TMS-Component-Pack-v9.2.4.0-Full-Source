This demo uses components that use internally components from both the TMS Component (http://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmspack.asp) and TMS Cloud Pack (http://www.tmssoftware.com/site/cloudpack.asp)

Therefore it is important that BOTH products are installed in the IDE.
When this is the case, the TAdvmyCloudDataFormPanel and TAdvmyCloudDataFormBox can be installed in the IDE.

To do this, open in the IDE the package:

TMSmCDD*.dproj

with * equal to:
2011: Delphi XE
XE2: Delphi XE2
XE3: Delphi XE3
XE4: Delphi XE4
XE5: Delphi XE5
XE6: Delphi XE6
XE7: Delphi XE7
XE8: Delphi XE8
XE9: Delphi 10 Seattle
XE10: Delphi 10.1 Berlin
XE11: Delphi 10.2 Tokyo
XE12: Delphi 10.3 Rio

and compile & install this package into the IDE. This will result in TAdvmyCloudDataFormPanel and TAdvmyCloudDataFormBox being added to the tool palette.

After this step, you can open the AdvmyCloudData demo in the IDE.
